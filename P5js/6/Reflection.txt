For this project, I built an interactive optical illusion using p5.js. I started with a rotating spiral of shapes, using simple math to keep the movement smooth and balanced. I wanted the visuals to be soft, so I added gentle color changes to avoid making it too bright or overwhelming.

To make it more interactive, I connected the mouse position to the animation. Moving the mouse changed the speed of rotation and the size of the shapes, so users could control what was happening. I also added a feature where clicking the screen switched between different shapes, like circles, squares, triangles, and lines, so the pattern would keep changing.

The hardest part was making sure the animation stayed interesting but not too busy or harsh on the eyes. I learned how to create simple but engaging visuals, and how to let people interact with the design without it feeling too complicated.
